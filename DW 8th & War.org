 Most of the build-up of this story is done in /Zagreus/, since /Neverland/, /Zagreus/ and /Scherzo/ are basically one big 8-hour story. So if you're listening to /Scherzo/ on its own, it's just completely serious and it's rather odd.

 It was essentially the "beginning of the end" of the¬†Divergent Universe¬†arc. The story began to "pay off" the Divergent Universe arc by explaining things like the¬†Interzone, the¬†Kro'ka's motivations and fears, how a universe without¬†time¬†worked and the¬†Divergence¬†itself.
