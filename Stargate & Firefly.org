A pivotal chapter in the history of Battlestar Galactica, the reimagined series‚Ä¶ set before the destruction of the Twelve Colonies of Kobol! In developing the next generation of Cylons, getting the models to look human was the easy part. But acting human is another story. Witness the evolution of Number Six as she learns to live, to love‚Ä¶ and to hate.

*** BSG vs BSG (TOS/TRS crossover)
*** Gods and Monsters :P2016:

takes place during the second season of the Re-imagined Series, covering /Gaius Baltar's/ rebuild of a /Cylon Centurion/ he calls /Tallos/ and the threat it poses to /Cylon/ agents hiding in the Fleet.

*** Twilight Command :P2019:

It‚Äôs a dangerous time for the last remaining humans. Captured by the Cylons on New Caprica, the colonists live in fear of what every new day will bring. As the Cylons press their oppressive‚Äìand life-threatening agenda‚Äîthe survivors grow more desperate to reclaim their freedom. But there‚Äôs hope. Out in the wilds of New Caprica, beyond the Cylon boundaries, is a band of human freedom fighters. They answer to no one. They fear no Cylons. They are Twilight Command‚Äìand they have a plan. From writer Michael Moreci (Wasted Space, Archie Meets Batman ‚Äô66) and artist Breno Tamura (Batgirl and the Birds of Prey) comes the untold tale of Twilight Command!

*Star Wars: Clone Wars* is an animated television series that chronicles the _Clone Wars_ between
the _Galactic Republic_ and the _Confederacy of Independent Systems_. Produced by _Cartoon Network
Studios_ , the series originally aired from 2003 to 2005, and was intended to serve as a bridge
between the films /Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones/ and /Star Wars: Episode III Revenge
of the Sith/. The series consists of twenty-five chapters; Seasons 1 and 2 (Volume I) are made
up of three-minute installments, while Season 3 (Volume II) is made up of twelve-to-fifteen
minute installments. The success of Star Wars: Clone Wars led to production of the similarly
titled /Star Wars: The Clone Wars/.
