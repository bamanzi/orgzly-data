 建议在2x17之后观看

在看完第三季之前不要看最后10分钟

*** The Resistance (10集短篇)

这部网络剧的作用是连接第二季和第三季，有 1 到 10 的合集版，十分推荐

*** The Plan

Set during the events from the Miniseries to Season 2's /"Lay Down Your Burdens, Part II (2x20),"/ this story is told from the Cylons' perspective, centering on two distinct Cavil copies as they try to fulfill the Cylons' plan.

**** HALF Baltar
*** Season Zero (#0-12)
*** ongoing (#0-12) :P2006:🛒:

The first series of issues based on the Re-imagined Series written by Greg Pak and pencilled by Nigel Raynor. The storyline appears after the events of "Home, Part II" (2x07) and before "Pegasus" (2x10) and significantly diverge from the Re-imagined Series' timeline of Season 2.

*** Pegasus (one-shot) :🛒:

https://en.battlestarwiki.org/Battlestar_Galactica:_Pegasus

The story is obviously set within the two-year span where humanoid Cylon infiltration began, likely within a year prior to /the Fall of the Twelve Colonies/ based on comments at the start of the story from a Number Six, Simon and Number Five.

*** Six :P2014:

Between April and August 2014, Dynamite produced a 5-issue series on the origins of Six.


A pivotal chapter in the history of Battlestar Galactica, the reimagined series… set before the destruction of the Twelve Colonies of Kobol! In developing the next generation of Cylons, getting the models to look human was the easy part. But acting human is another story. Witness the evolution of Number Six as she learns to live, to love… and to hate.

*** BSG vs BSG (TOS/TRS crossover)
*** Gods and Monsters :P2016:

 All new stories from the ground-breaking re-imagined series! Baltar believes he was chosen by god— and now moves closer to being one himself when he constructs a living Cylon Centurion! Is it his greatest achievement or biggest mistake? Truly obedient or waiting for the perfect time to strike? Is it the protector of Sharon’s unborn baby or its greatest threat? Will the Cylon’s bloody history repeat itself?

*** Twilight Command  (TOS?) :P2019:

It’s a dangerous time for the last remaining humans. Captured by the Cylons on New Caprica, the colonists live in fear of what every new day will bring. As the Cylons press their oppressive–and life-threatening agenda—the survivors grow more desperate to reclaim their freedom. But there’s hope. Out in the wilds of New Caprica, beyond the Cylon boundaries, is a band of human freedom fighters. They answer to no one. They fear no Cylons. They are Twilight Command–and they have a plan. From writer Michael Moreci (Wasted Space, Archie Meets Batman ’66) and artist Breno Tamura (Batgirl and the Birds of Prey) comes the untold tale of Twilight Command!
