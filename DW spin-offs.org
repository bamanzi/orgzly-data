Torchwood vs Monsters!

Margaret Blaine is the Mayor of Cardiff. She's also an alien who'll do anything to get off the planet Earth. When a spaceship crashes outside Cardiff, it seems like the answer to her prayers. But she's not the only person at crash site.

Suzie Costello works for Torchwood, but strictly to her own agenda. When a spaceship crashes outside Cardiff, it seems like the answer to her prayers. But she's not the only person at the crash site.

Bonded by an alien device, Margaret and Suzie find themselves on the run from Torchwood, the police, and six warp missiles that'll destroy them, Cardiff, and most of the Western Hemisphere.

Megwyn Jones is one of the most hated women in Britain. She used to run a home for troubled children in an isolated part of Snowdonia called The Hope. For a long time there were rumours about what was happening there, and then one day it was realised that the children had gone missing.

Ever since, Megwyn's kept her peace. Is she innocent? Is she guilty? Where are the bodies?

The years have been long and hard on Megwyn and on the families of the children. But now Megwyn's dying, and she's agreed to go back to The Hope, to reveal the horrible secret she's kept all these years.

Blind Summit was a company run by Pascal Babich. They developed Excellium from information from the Brett Archive with the intention of creating super-soldiers. They were thwarted in their plans by Yvonne Hartman and Ianto Jones. (AUDIO: Blind Summit) They later formed Temporary Solutions, which again was stopped by Torchwood London. (AUDIO: 9 to 5)

Welcome, Mesdames et Messieurs, to The Bumptious Gastropod.

The most exclusive, most discreet dining experience outside the universe. For the restaurant exists beyond spacetime itself, and the usual rules of causality do not apply. Anything could happen.

It is here that the Doctor has a date. With River Song. And with death.

Stories of the Furies abound across the cosmos: vengeful spirits hounding guilty souls to death. Madame Kovarian taught them to a child raised in fear, trained to kill, and placed inside a spacesuit.

Kovarian knows the universe’s greatest threat, the Doctor must be eliminated. An assassin was created for that purpose.

But if Melody Pond has failed, Kovarian will simply have to try again...

偶然间发现还有如此萌的一集jacobi master遂烤之，老头实在过于贱萌，jacobi老师也太会了
和UNIT以及Kate的互动也非常好吃，还提了点准将更是美死我了。。。

总之欢迎大家品尝……
