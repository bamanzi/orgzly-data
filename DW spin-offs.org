Torchwood¬†vs Monsters!

Margaret Blaine¬†is the¬†Mayor of Cardiff. She's also¬†an alien¬†who'll do anything to get off the planet¬†Earth. When¬†a spaceship¬†crashes outside¬†Cardiff, it seems like the answer to her prayers. But she's not the only person at crash site.

Suzie Costello¬†works for Torchwood, but strictly to her own agenda. When a spaceship crashes outside Cardiff, it seems like the answer to her prayers. But she's not the only person at the crash site.

Bonded by an alien device, Margaret and Suzie find themselves on the run from Torchwood, the¬†police, and six¬†warp missiles¬†that'll destroy them, Cardiff, and most of the¬†Western Hemisphere.

Megwyn Jones¬†is one of the most hated women in¬†Britain. She used to run a home for troubled children in an isolated part of¬†Snowdonia¬†called¬†The Hope. For a long time there were rumours about what was happening there, and then one day it was realised that the children had gone missing.

Ever since, Megwyn's kept her peace. Is she innocent? Is she guilty? Where are the bodies?

The years have been long and hard on Megwyn and on the families of the children. But now Megwyn's dying, and she's agreed to go back to The Hope, to reveal the horrible secret she's kept all these years.

But if¬†Melody Pond¬†has failed, Kovarian will simply have to try again...
